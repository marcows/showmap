ShowMap
=======

This is a [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) Add-On which
helps you to open another map from the current map view.

Exemplary use case: You visit [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
and want to know what this map area looks like in another map like *Google
Maps*. Now you can open that map with just two mouse clicks. Search for the
*ShowMap* toolbar icon in shape of a globe.

This Add-On is developed with the *Jetpack Add-On SDK* and its *jpm* command line
tool. Unfortunately this SDK is no longer supported and does not work in
current Firefox versions (57 and newer). Mozilla has switched to
*WebExtensions* and dropped the legacy APIs. Of course some day this Add-On
should be converted to be usable with the latest Firefox version, but until
then [Waterfox](https://waterfoxproject.org/) can be used for it.
